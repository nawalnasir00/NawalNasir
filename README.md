# NawalNasir

The grades csv file is a sample data set from https://people.sc.fsu.edu/. It displays student's first and last names, four test grades, and their final grades. The report should display the data as well as calculate an average of all final grades of the students. The awk file is where the calculation of the average is done. The Makefile calls both the csv file and the awk script which would display all the information. 

To run this script, you would have to download the repository, "NawalNasir", make sure you are in the right repository in your terminal, and enter "make" in the command line.
